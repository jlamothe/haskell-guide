      <h1>About this Guide</h1>

      <p>This guide is written as a total beginner's guide to programming in Haskell.  There are many fine Haskell resources out there, so why add another?  Simply put, I'm not aware of any that don't assume that you have at least <strong>some</strong> programming experience.  This is probably because Haskell isn't typically viewed as a beginner-friendly language.</p>

      <p>In my opinion, the reason for this is that Haskell is what's known as a <strong>purely funcitonal</strong> programming language, whereas the most commonly used languages (like C, Java, Python, etc.) are <strong>imperative</strong> languages.  Functional programmers need to think differently form imperative programmers.  Because of this, when you come to functional programming from an imperative background, in a lot of ways it's like learning to program all over again.  A new programmer doesn't have any pre-concieved ideas that need to be un-learned.</p>

      <p>So why Haskell?</p>

      <p>Well, it's my favourite language.  It's done more to change the way I think about programming than any other language, and it's taught me many concepts that I wish I had understood much earlier in my programming carreer.  In my humble opinion, Haskell makes you a better overall programmer.</p>

      <p>This brings us to the bigger (and perhaps more important) question, why learn to program at all?</p>

      <p>We live in a world that is increasingly run by computers.  We're surrounded by them, and they make countless decisions for us every day.  Have a phone?  It's really just a computer.  Your car is basically a computer on wheels.  In fact, some people's refrigerators are computers.  These days, they're everywhere.  Not only are they not a passing fad, but they're controlling more and more things as time marches on.</p>

      <p>Programming (or coding) is how we control the computers, and relatively few people ever learn how to do it.  It's probably fair to say that coding will be the literacy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

        <h1>How Programming Works (The Basics)</h1>

        <p>Before we write any actual code, it's probably important to go over a few things about how programming works.  A programmer writing a program (or app) is a lot like an architecht designing a house.  Programs are generally written in machine code, which is easy for a computer to read, but very hard for a human to read.  Also, machine code varies from system to system.  A Windows executable uses different machine code than a *NIX executable or a Mac application.  Therefore, programmers seldom if ever write directly in machine code.</p>

        <p>A programmer will usually write in a high-level, more human readable, language (Haskell in our case).  This is called the <strong>source code</strong>, and it's a lot like the blueprint to your house (or program).  After writing the source code, the programmer will hand it off to a program called a <strong>compiler</strong>.  The compiler is like the construction crew.  It takes your blueprint and builds the house with it.  There are also other parts like the linker, but we'll lump this all under the "compiler" umbrella for now.</p>

        <p>If you want to edit a program, it is pretty much a requirement to have the source code.  Without it, the job becomes <strong>much</strong> harder.  For this reason, companies like Microsoft and Apple go to great lengths to keep their soruce code private.  They don't want you messing around with their bread and butter.  The ethical implications of this are outside the scope of this guide.</p>
