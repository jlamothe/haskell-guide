<h1>The Non-Programmer's Guide to Haskell</h1>
<div class="byline">By: Jonathan Lamothe</div>

<h1>About this Guide</h1>

<p>This guide is written as a total beginner's guide to programming in Haskell.  There are many fine Haskell resources out there, so why add another?  Simply put, I'm not aware of any that don't assume that you have at least <strong>some</strong> programming experience.  This is probably because Haskell isn't typically viewed as a beginner-friendly language.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the reason for this is that Haskell is what's known as a <strong>purely funcitonal</strong> programming language, whereas the most commonly used languages (like C, Java, Python, etc.) are <strong>imperative</strong> languages.  Functional programmers need to think differently form imperative programmers.  Because of this, when you come to functional programming from an imperative background, in a lot of ways it's like learning to program all over again.  A new programmer doesn't have any pre-concieved ideas that need to be un-learned.</p>

<p>So why Haskell?</p>

<p>Well, it's my favourite language.  It's done more to change the way I think about programming than any other language, and it's taught me many concepts that I wish I had understood much earlier in my programming carreer.  In my humble opinion, Haskell makes you a better overall programmer.</p>

<p>This brings us to the bigger (and perhaps more important) question, why learn to program at all?</p>

<p>We live in a world that is increasingly run by computers.  We're surrounded by them, and they make countless decisions for us every day.  Have a phone?  It's really just a computer.  Your car is basically a computer on wheels.  In fact, some people's refrigerators are computers.  These days, they're everywhere.  Not only are they not a passing fad, but they're controlling more and more things as time marches on.  Programming (or coding) is how we control the computers, and relatively few people ever learn how to do it.  It's probably fair to say that coding will be the literacy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<section id="basics">
<h1>How Programming Works (The Basics)</h1>

<p>Before we write any actual code, it's probably important to go over a few things about how programming works.  A programmer writing a program (or app) is a lot like an architecht designing a house.  Programs are generally written in machine code, which is easy for a computer to read, but very hard for a human to read.  Also, machine code varies from system to system.  A Windows executable uses different machine code than a *NIX executable or a Mac application.  Therefore, programmers seldom if ever write directly in machine code.</p>

<p>A programmer will usually write in a high-level, more human readable, language (Haskell in our case).  This is called the <strong>source code</strong>, and it's a lot like the blueprint to your house (or program).  After writing the source code, the programmer will hand it off to a program called a <strong>compiler</strong>.  The compiler is like the construction crew.  It takes your blueprint and builds the house with it.  There are also other parts like the linker, but we'll lump this all under the "compiler" umbrella for now.</p>

<p>If you want to edit a program, it is pretty much a requirement to have the source code.  Without it, the job becomes <strong>much</strong> harder.  For this reason, companies like Microsoft and Apple go to great lengths to keep their soruce code private.  They don't want you messing around with their bread and butter.  The ethical implications of this are outside the scope of this guide.</p>

<section id="installing">
<h1>Installing Haskell</h1>

<p>So, the first thing we're going to need to do is install Haskell.  I like to use a tool called Stack.  Stack automatically manages the entire Haskell toolchain for you.  It's the most user-friendly way to go.</p>

<p>If you run a POSIX-compliant operating system (basically, anything other than Windows) you can install it by typing <code>curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh</code> in your terminal and pressing enter.</p>

<p>If you run Windows, you'll have to get the installer from <a href="https://haskellstack.org">the Haskell Stack website</a>.</p>

<section>
<h1>Text Editors</h1>

<p>At this point, you'll have basically all the tools that you'll need to start programming with one exception.  You're going to need a text editor.  It doesn't really matter much which one you use, so if you have a preference, feel free to stick with that one.  There's one exception to this, but I'll get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you use Windows, I recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.  I <strong>do not</strong> recommend using the Notepad that comes with Windows itself.  It chokes when handling UNIX-format text files, or at least it did the last time I checked (several years ago).  Do yourself a favour; use <strong>anything</strong> else.</p>

<p>If you're using a Linux or other UNIX-style system like me, I recommend <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">gedit</a>.  I tend to use emacs myself, because it's more powerful, but it's also not very newbie-friendly.</p>

<p>The platform I have the least personal experience with is MacOS.  I don't know much about the text editors that are available, but most of my Mac-using peers seem to like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.  I've played with it a little, and my only real complaint I have is that it's nagware.  It asks you to pay, but will continue to work just fine even if you don't.</p>

<section id="hello-world">
<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>Now that you have all your tools, it's time to write every the program that is traditionally written by every new programmer, the "hello world" program.  It's basically the simplest program that you can write.</p>

<p>Simply open a new document in your text editor of choice and write the following:</p>

<code class="block">
main = putStrLn "Hello, world!"
</code>

<p>Now, save the file as <code>hello.hs</code>.  All Haskell source code ends in <code>.hs</code> (or <code>.lhs</code>, but we won't discuss this here).</p>

<p>The next thing we'll need to do is compile it.  To do this, open your terminal, and change into the directory that has your file in it, then enter the command <code>stack ghc hello.hs</code>.  If this is your first time doing this, it might take a while, because stack might have to download the compiler (ghc) first.</p>

<p>If everything goes well, once this completes you'll now have an executable file called <code>hello</code> (or <code>hello.exe</code>) if you're running Windows.  To run it, type <code>./hello</code> (or just <code>hello</code> in Windows).</p>
