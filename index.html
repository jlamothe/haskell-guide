      <h1>About this Guide</h1>

      <p>This guide is written as a total beginner's guide to programming in Haskell.  There are many fine Haskell resources out there, so why add another?  Simply put, I'm not aware of any that don't assume that you have at least <strong>some</strong> programming experience.  This is probably because Haskell isn't typically viewed as a beginner-friendly language.</p>

      <p>In my opinion, the reason for this is that haskell is what's known as a <strong>purely funcitonal</strong> programming language, whereas the most commonly used languages (like C, Java, Python, etc.) are <strong>imperative</strong> languages.  Functional programmers need to think differently form imperative programmers, and so, when you come from an imperative background, in a lot of ways it's like learning to program all over again.  In short, a new programmer doesn't have any pre-concieved ideas that need to be un-learned.</p>

      <p>So why Haskell?</p>

      <p>Well, it's my favourite language.  It's done more to change the way I think about programming than any other language, and it's taught me many concepts that I wish I had understood much earlier in my programming carreer.  In my humble opinion, Haskell makes you a better overall programmer.</p>

      <p>This brings us to the bigger (and perhaps more inportant) question, why learn to program at all?</p>

      <p>We live in a world that is increasingly run by computers.  We're surrounded by them, and they almost invisibly make countless decisions for us every day.  Have a phone?  It's really just a specialized computer.  Your car is basically a computer on wheels.  In fact, some people's refrigerators are computers.  Not only are they not a passing fad, but they're controlling more and more things as time marches on.</p>

      <p>Programming (or coding) is how we control the computers, and relatively few people ever learn how to do it.  It's probably fair to say that coding will be the literacy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
